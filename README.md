# Apprenticeship Drouput Rate Analysis
A project conducted on datasets provided by the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (MAESD) that were analyzed to find patterns and correlations in the data that would explain the high drouput rates from apprenticeship programs.

This repository contains all the SAS code files, the `.csv` files that were used in the data analysis, and a `.docx` report and `.pptx`  presentation summarizing all our findings.
